<p>Fundamental building blocks for solving problems using computers.
Topics include basic computer organization and programming constructs:
memory, CPU, binary arithmetic, variables, expressions, statements,
conditionals, iteration, functions, parameters, recursion, primitive and
composite data types, and basic operating system and debugging
tools.</p>
<p>C++ is the programming language used in this course.</p>

<h2 id="online-textbook">Online Textbook</h2>
<p>Homework, reading assignments, and labs (at least initially) will be
administered via the online <strong>Zybook</strong>. To join the
textbook, follow the instructions below: 1. Sign in or create an account
at learn.zybooks.com 2. Enter zyBook code: UCSBCMPSC16QuevedoSummer2022

<li><strong>Gradescope and/or GitHub:</strong> Eventually we will be
submitting lab assignments to Gradescope and/or Github. More to</li>

<h2 id="graded-components">Graded Components</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Reading:</strong> Between each class, you’ll have reading
to do in the textbook. There is too much information you need to learn
in this course for you to get all of it in lecture, so the readings are
essential. The reading assignments for the next class can be found in
the lecture notes for that class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Homework:</strong> Homeworks will be posted on the course
website each week. These will be synergistic with the reading. As you
complete reading assignments in the Zybook, the homework problems
(consisting of Practice and Challenge Activities in the Zybook reading)
can be completed simultaneously. Specific PAs and CAs will be assigned
on the course website each week.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quizzes:</strong> Quizzes will be administered at the end
of each week. Exact dates and times of quizzes is TBD (at the
present).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Programming Assignments / Labs:</strong> Programming
assignments (also called labs) are given once a week, and are typically
started in Lab Sections on Wednesdays. You may work on them during
closed labs and plan to finish the assignment on your own time outside
of lab. You must however, read the assignment and attempt the parts that
you do with little assistant as soon as the assignment is released. The
assumption is that you at the very least read the assignment before your
lab section. You are encouraged to use pair programming in most of the
labs but please read the collaboration policy for each lab. Some labs
have to be completed individually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Exam / Final Project:</strong> TBD</p></li>

<p><strong>Curving:</strong> The grade scale represents the minimum
letter grade you will be assigned. At the instructor’s discretion, the
grading scale may be altered in the students’ favor if this will better
reflect the students’ mastery of the material. Thus, if there is a
“curve”, it will be applied at the end, <strong>NOT</strong> to
individual assignments.</p>
<p><strong>A+ Grades:</strong> These may be awarded to the very best
performing students in the class—but the cutoff for A+ grades will be
determined at the end of the course at the discretion of the instructor
(there is no pre-determined cutoff—an average of 97 or more doesn’t
guarantee you an A+ grade.)</p>
